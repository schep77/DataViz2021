# DataViz2021 Projects

This repo contains all of the projects I completed during Fall 2021 in my Data Visualizations class. For my projects, I used Airplane crash data from 1908 till 2019 to analyze the data and create meaningful visualizations.

Here is a sample of the work.

## Mini Project 1:
This graph shows the Fatalities per Year, and Per Decade.

## Mini Project 2:
This is a Bi-gram of the crash summary just to try and see if there was a common reason recorded for these crashes.
